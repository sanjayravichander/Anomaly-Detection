# Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning
Anomaly detection in a project involves identifying unusual or unexpected patterns or behaviors in data. The goal is to automatically detect instances that deviate significantly from the norm, indicating potential issues, errors, or abnormalities. Here's a simple explanation of why anomaly detection projects are done and what we can infer from them:

# Why Anomaly Detection?
Anomaly detection helps identify problems or irregularities in data early on. This is crucial for preventing issues from escalating into more significant problems.

# Improving Data Quality:
It assists in maintaining and improving the overall quality of data by flagging anomalies that might be errors, outliers, or unusual patterns.

# Fraud Detection:
In finance or cybersecurity, anomaly detection is used to identify unusual transactions or activities that might indicate fraudulent behavior.

# Predictive Maintenance:
In industries such as manufacturing, anomaly detection can predict potential equipment failures or malfunctions by identifying abnormal sensor readings.

# Health Monitoring:
In healthcare, anomaly detection can be used to monitor patients' health data, identifying unusual trends that might indicate a health issue.
